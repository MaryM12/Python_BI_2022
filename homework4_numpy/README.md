# Numpy Challenge

## Usage
The module provides some functions for Numpy arrays:

- matrix_multiplication — takes 2 matrices and outputs multiplication product <br />
- multiplication_check — checks if the matrices can be multiplied in the order they appear in the list <br />
- multiply_matrices — consecutivily multiplies the matrices in the list, if possible <br />
- compute_2d_distance complement — outputs the Euclidean distance between two vectors in 2D <br />
- compute_multidimensional_distance — outputs the Euclidean distance between two vectors in multidimensional
   space <br />
- compute_pair_distances — takes a 2d array and outpus a matrix of pairwise euclidian distances between its rows  <br />

## Dependencies
